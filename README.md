IMPORTANT NOTE: NETWORKING IS NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL. THIS PROJECT IS FOR SHOWCASE ONLY.
IMPORTANT NOTE 2: BELLO BANKING CONSOLE EDITION IS THE ONLY WORKING VERSION RIGHT NOW. THE MAIN BELLO BANKING FILE IS CURRENTLY A PLACEHOLDER FOR WHEN I MAKE THE GUI VERSION, AND SHOULD BE IGNORED AT THIS TIME.

Bello Banking was made to mimic apps like CashApp, where you can send money to other users and utilize it as a banking app. This project has a lot of history for me, as when I was first trying to get into programming four or so years ago, I tried making a banking app as my first real project. Of course, that didn't go anywhere as I didn't know nearly enough about computer science back then, but now I was actually able to make it!

This project has allowed me to create a C# project that's not just a game, and has made me have to learn the basics of MySQL (and eventually WPF once I get the GUI version made!). I hope you enjoy checking it out!
